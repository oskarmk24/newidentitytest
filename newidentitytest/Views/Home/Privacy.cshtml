    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>This report system is a locally hosted application developed for educational purposes at the University of Agder. The system allows users to register and report obstacles or issues within a given environment.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Storage and Usage</h3>
    <p>All data entered into this system is stored locally on the host computer and is not shared, transmitted, or accessible by any external parties or online services. The data is used solely for testing and demonstration within the scope of this project.</p>
    
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>No personal information is collected beyond what is necessary for the functionality of the reporting system. Data remains stored locally until the database is manually cleared or the project files are removed.</p>
    
    <h3>Compliance</h3>
    <p>Because this site runs only on a local server and is not publicly accessible, it complies with basic privacy and data protection principles in an educational context.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Retention</h3>
    <p>All user data and reports are retained locally on the host system for the duration of the project. Once the project is completed or the application is decommissioned, all data will be permanently deleted.</p>
    
    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the handling of your data, please contact the project administrators at the University of Agder.</p>
